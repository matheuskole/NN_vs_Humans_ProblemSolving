# NN_vs_Humans_ProblemSolving
This repository contains the research, experiments, and analysis for a comparative study between neural networks and human users in problem-solving.

In this project, the main idea was to develop logic puzzles and games for a comparison between neural networks and human users. Different games
were created, including:
        -CacthBall: a game that a ball drops and the agent needs to catch it before it hits the floor;
        -MazeGame: the traditional Maze;
        -DarkMazeGame: the same concept as the previous game, but in this case the agent can only see the adjacents positions.
