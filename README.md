# NN_vs_Humans_ProblemSolving
🧠This repository contains the research, experiments, and analysis for a comparative study between neural networks and human users in problem-solving.

🔍 Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop and analyze logic puzzles and games to compare the problem-solving abilities of neural networks and human participants. The study explores key differences in learning strategies, adaptability, and decision-making processes.

🎮 Developed Games
To evaluate both AI and human problem-solving skills, we designed different types of games, including:

CatchBall 🎾: A game where a ball drops, and the agent needs to catch it before it hits the floor.
MazeGame 🏁: A traditional maze, where the agent must find the exit.
DarkMazeGame 🌑: A variation of the MazeGame, but the agent can only see adjacent positions, making navigation more challenging.

📊 Research Objectives
Compare performance metrics (accuracy, time, and efficiency) between neural networks and human users.
Analyze how different learning approaches (reinforcement learning, human intuition) impact decision-making.
Evaluate AI's ability to generalize across different problem-solving environments.

🚀 Next Steps
Fine-tuning AI models for better decision-making.
Expanding dataset for more robust analysis.
Running controlled experiments with human participants.
